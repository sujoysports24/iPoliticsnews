The 32-year-old has made approaching 550 appearances for United in more than a decade.<\/p>\n<p>In that time, he has won the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup twice and the Europa League too. However, his contract with United is poised to expire this summer and he is yet to sign the fresh terms offered.<\/p>\n<p>READ MORE: Man United&#8217;s remaining Premier League fixtures compared with Newcastle, Liverpool FC and rivals<\/p>\n<p>United are happy to give De Gea a new contract providing he signs on reduced terms. The goalkeeper is in negotiations over an extension and the official announcement is expected soon.<\/p>\n<p>Dean Henderson has spent the season in the Premier League on loan at Nottingham Forest. He will return to Old Trafford this summer after not playing since mid-January for Forest following a torn thigh, which he has had successful surgery on and is poised to be ready for action in time for pre-season.<\/p>\n<p>Berbatov believes de Gea deserves to continue as United&#8217;s number one shot-stopper, but that Henderson also deserves to have a chance at Old Trafford which the former striker feels the 26-year-old has not had yet. He believes a fight for the number one spot is something which would benefit both de Gea and Henderson, but that Mike Maignan of AC Milan is a player which Erik ten Hag ought to consider if he wants to bring in reinforcements this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to Betfred, Berbatov said: \u201cIf somebody that\u2019s better than David de Gea comes along, challenges him for his place and proves themselves to be better than David, then of course that somebody needs a chance to be the club\u2019s number one.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the moment, I believe that De Gea should be Manchester United\u2019s number one. David is making mistakes and he will make mistakes in the future, but you can\u2019t forget the many times that he\u2019s saved the club from defeat. He deserves more credit than he gets. He\u2019s done an awful lot for Manchester United and he\u2019s a true great.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI saw that Erik ten Hag said that he counts on David to stay at the club and it\u2019s obvious that David needs to work on his footwork, as well as his ability to play out from the back, and I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s aware of this. Those are the only things that I believe he needs to work on.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI believe that Dean Henderson deserves a chance at Manchester United, as I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s been given a chance previously. He needs to be given a real chance to show what he can do. If Erik ten Hag gives him a chance to prove himself next season, then I believe that will be beneficial for both Dean and David de Gea, as David needs to be properly challenged.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf the club decides to go into the transfer market for a new goalkeeper this summer instead, then Mike Maignan of AC Milan is very good in my opinion and he deserves to be looked at by Manchester United.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SAMUEL LUCKHURST DISSECTS OLE GUNNAR SOLSKJAER&#8217;S RECENT COMMENTS Dimitar Berbatov believes David de Gea deserves to continue as Manchester United&#8217;s number one goalkeeper but that Dean Henderson deserves a proper chance at&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":64,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/63"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=63"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/63\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":65,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/63\/revisions\/65"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/64"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=63"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=63"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/iPoliticsnews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=63"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
