										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SAMUEL LUCKHURST DISSECTS OLE GUNNAR SOLSKJAER&#8217;S RECENT COMMENTS<br />
Dimitar Berbatov believes David de Gea deserves to continue as Manchester United&#8217;s number one goalkeeper but that Dean Henderson deserves a proper chance at Old Trafford to show what he can do.</p>
<p>De Gea has been first choice at United for much of his career at Old Trafford, since joining from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2011 as Edwin van der Sar&#8217;s replacement. The 32-year-old has made approaching 550 appearances for United in more than a decade.</p>
<p>In that time, he has won the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup twice and the Europa League too. However, his contract with United is poised to expire this summer and he is yet to sign the fresh terms offered.</p>
<p>READ MORE: Man United&#8217;s remaining Premier League fixtures compared with Newcastle, Liverpool FC and rivals</p>
<p>United are happy to give De Gea a new contract providing he signs on reduced terms. The goalkeeper is in negotiations over an extension and the official announcement is expected soon.</p>
<p>Dean Henderson has spent the season in the Premier League on loan at Nottingham Forest. He will return to Old Trafford this summer after not playing since mid-January for Forest following a torn thigh, which he has had successful surgery on and is poised to be ready for action in time for pre-season.</p>
<p>Berbatov believes de Gea deserves to continue as United&#8217;s number one shot-stopper, but that Henderson also deserves to have a chance at Old Trafford which the former striker feels the 26-year-old has not had yet. He believes a fight for the number one spot is something which would benefit both de Gea and Henderson, but that Mike Maignan of AC Milan is a player which Erik ten Hag ought to consider if he wants to bring in reinforcements this summer.</p>
<p>Speaking to Betfred, Berbatov said: “If somebody that’s better than David de Gea comes along, challenges him for his place and proves themselves to be better than David, then of course that somebody needs a chance to be the club’s number one.</p>
<p>“At the moment, I believe that De Gea should be Manchester United’s number one. David is making mistakes and he will make mistakes in the future, but you can’t forget the many times that he’s saved the club from defeat. He deserves more credit than he gets. He’s done an awful lot for Manchester United and he’s a true great.</p>
<p>“I saw that Erik ten Hag said that he counts on David to stay at the club and it’s obvious that David needs to work on his footwork, as well as his ability to play out from the back, and I’m sure that he’s aware of this. Those are the only things that I believe he needs to work on.</p>
<p>“I believe that Dean Henderson deserves a chance at Manchester United, as I don’t believe he’s been given a chance previously. He needs to be given a real chance to show what he can do. If Erik ten Hag gives him a chance to prove himself next season, then I believe that will be beneficial for both Dean and David de Gea, as David needs to be properly challenged.</p>
<p>“If the club decides to go into the transfer market for a new goalkeeper this summer instead, then Mike Maignan of AC Milan is very good in my opinion and he deserves to be looked at by Manchester United.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a landmark move, Sweden became the first country to recognize sex as a sport. So why is sex a good workout? Read on for his 5 benefits of fitness through sex.</p>
<p>Exercise is essential to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. From hitting the gym to participating in outdoor activities, we actively seek out ways to keep our bodies healthy and active. Surprisingly, one of his fun activities that is often overlooked as a potential workout is sex. Ladies, the benefits of sex aren’t just physical pleasures, they can also help improve her level of fitness.</p>
<p>While going to the gym and working out at home are irreplaceable, Healthshot is working with Shobha Subramanian, a physician consultant at Fortis Hospital Mulund, Mumbai, to understand why sex is good physical activity. We spoke with Dr. Itrikar.</p>
<p>Here’s why sex can be a good workout<br />
When you think about sex, you also have to think about stamina and flexibility. Indulging in sex often helps. Here are five reasons why sex can be a good workout, according to Dr. Subramanian.</p>
<p>1. Sex Increases Your Heart Rate<br />
As with any aerobic or aerobic exercise, your heart rate may increase during sex. Increased heart rate strengthens the heart muscle and helps promote cardiovascular health. In addition, increased blood flow improves oxygen supply to different parts of the body and strengthens the immune system.</p>

2. Burn calories<br />
Sex is a calorie-burning activity. That’s why intercourse helps burn calories and contributes to weight management. However, the exact number of calories burned depends on factors such as time, intensity, and body weight. A small study of 21 healthy heterosexual couples in their 20s, published in the Public Science Library journal PLOS One, found that during a 24-minute sex session (including foreplay), men averaged It showed that 101 calories (4.2 calories per person) were consumed. 1 minute), women burned 69 calories (3.1 calories per minute). Although the number of calories burned is small, it indicates that this intimate activity may contribute to overall calorie expenditure.</p>
<p>3. Muscle work<br />
During sex, different muscles in the body work together. Depending on the position and movement involved, you can train your core, legs, buttocks and even your upper body muscles. Regular sex helps tone and strengthen these muscle groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Reduce stress and improve mood<br />
There is no doubt that sex helps release endorphins, the body’s natural feel-good hormones. They calm the mind and lighten the spirit, providing an immediate mood boost. The best time to have sex is first thing in the morning. Morning sex can leave anyone feeling more relaxed, focused, and upbeat throughout the day. Overall, sex is a way to relax and improve your overall health.</p>

5. Improved flexibility and balance<br />
Certain sex positions often require flexibility and a wide range of motion. Practicing different sex positions improves range of motion, flexibility and stability. Additionally, it helps to stretch and relax your muscles. Therefore, regular sexual activity can improve overall physical performance.</p>
<p>Note that while sex has these benefits, it should not be considered a substitute for a regular exercise routine. Incorporating other forms of physical activity, such as cardio and strength training, remains important for maintaining overall fitness and health. Apart from this, please prioritize open communication and the use of appropriate safeguards to ensure a safe and positive experience.</p>

With the growth of smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT), wearables are becoming an increasingly popular way to collect data, monitor health, and connect with the environment. One of the key technological improvements driving the wearable business is the development of smaller and more powerful sensors and processors. These improvements have made it possible to build wearables that can measure a wide range of biometric data, including heart rate, blood pressure, and even brain waves. In addition, the development of new materials and manufacturing processes is also a key driver of the wearable market on a global level. These advances have enabled the development of wearables that are more comfortable, durable and fashionable than ever before.</p>
<p>Target dynamic demographics such as people with disabilities</p>
<p>Many companies target different demographics, such as child-centric, gender-specific, and disabled. For example, South Korean startup Dot Inc. is a company focused on developing smart wearables for visually impaired individuals. The company’s product, the Dot Watch, is a Braille smartwatch that uses Braille tactile cells to display notifications, messages, and time, making information self-accessible to people with visual impairments. The company received his US$500,000 grant from the South Korean government’s Tech Incubator Program for Startups (TIPS) and his US$100,000 grant from the ActnerLab accelerator.

<p>Governments in many countries are promoting the use of smart wearables. As Japan’s healthcare spending rises, the government is adopting various methods to save costs by increasing R&amp;D investment and introducing regulations on digital health products and services. Recent trends indicate that Japanese customers are more interested in cutting-edge products from US digital health companies. The smartphone usage rate in Japan is 90.8% among those aged 13-19 and 99.0% among those aged 20-29. The majority of Japanese teens and young adults, including university students aged 18-22, use smartphones all day long. For this reason, the Japanese government has focused on implementing various strategies to boost demand for smart wearable products in the country.</p>
<p>Adoption of smartwatches and fitness bands increases</p>
<p>Growing consumer interest in fitness and wellness is one of the main drivers of the smart wearables industry. People are becoming more health conscious and want to know how to measure their physical activity to improve their overall health. Smart wearables are becoming increasingly popular because they can track exercise, monitor health, and quickly access information while on the move.

<p>Growing applications of smart clothing in various industries such as sports and fitness, healthcare, military, and defense are driving the global smart clothing market. Over the projected period, the growing need to monitor physical activity via sensors is likely to drive demand for smart clothing. According to a recent World Economic Forum (WEF) poll, 92.1% of business owners expect 10% of people to wear internet-connected clothing by 2025. In addition, newly created advanced fibers such as nanofibers and hybrid materials may be used. To promote the smart clothing industry in the coming years.</p>
<p>Impact of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</p>
<p>The global smart wearables market has been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, global market sales declined due to supply chain disruptions and retail store closures.

Remote patient monitoring is also growing in popularity, with healthcare workers deploying smart wearables to remotely monitor patients and reduce the chance of viral transmission.</p>
<p>Effects of the Russo-Ukrainian War</p>
<p>The Russo-Ukrainian war has disrupted supply chains at the global level. Many smart wearable devices are made in China, a major supplier of electronic components. But China is a close ally of Russia, and the war cut off supply lines for these parts. The result has been component shortages, smart wearable manufacturing delays, and price hikes. In addition, the war forced many manufacturers to relocate. This could be an opportunity for other countries to strengthen their manufacturing capacity and become more competitive in the global smart wearables market.</p>
<p>Status and prospects of major companies</p>
<p>The global smart wearables market is highly competitive, and market players are looking for a competitive edge in this rapidly growing industry, primarily by catering to the millennial demographic.</p>
<p>Leading companies in the industry employ various advertising strategies to effectively reach target audiences, increase brand awareness and drive product sales. Collaboration and influencer marketing are widely adopted by companies today. For example, Fitbit has partnered with fitness influencers and big-name artists such as Will His Smith and Jules Sebastian to promote their Fitness His trackers and smartwatches. Additionally, the company collaborates with TV shows, movies, and popular events to showcase its products. One example is his use of Fitbit devices in his TV series like “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” It shows the character using his Fitbit products as part of his daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world’s leading autonomous robotic delivery provider, one of our core missions is to make people’s lives easier and more convenient.</p>
<p>We are passionate believers in the power of technology and innovation to positively impact lives and communities. But we also know that accessibility and the needs of people with disabilities are too often overlooked in technology development.</p>
<p>We are at the forefront of a whole new industry, so we know we won’t get everything right the first time. But at Starship, a true two-way approach to accessibility and accessibility needs is embedded in what we do, and we’re dedicated to building on what we’ve learned along the way.</p>
<p>Over the years, we have invested time and resources in improving our technology with accessibility in mind. Mobility, for example, he was able to incorporate autonomous recognition of devices and wheelchairs into the behavior of robots.</p>
<p>We want the robot to be able to hear sounds as it navigates the sidewalks, and that the grocery store is at a height that most wheelchair users can reach (and that the items are packed in bags for easy handling). ) is important. We have worked with leading blind charities to ensure guide dogs and our robots happily share their paths. We also incorporate feedback from our guests with disabilities, residents and charities into our engineering and design process, improving our efforts with each trip and conversation.</p>
<p>But there is still work to be done.</p>
<p>That’s why today, on Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we proudly launch the Starship Accessibility Advisory Panel.</p>
<p>We welcomed a panel of representatives from the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB), the University of Leeds, and the health and welfare charity Leonard Cheshire to help bring a living professional experience integral to the conversation across the organization. I am glad to</p>
<p>This is a start, not an end, and we want to ensure that we have the experience, representation, and perspective of people from different backgrounds, with different disabilities and abilities. Based on the current board members, we would especially like to hear directly from people who use mobility devices, wheelchairs, and/or are nervously diverse within the surgical area.</p>
